# Non-invasive Phenotyping for Water and Nitrogen Uptake by Deep Roots Explored using Machine Learning
Background and aims: 
Root distribution over the soil profile is important for crop resource uptake. Using machine learning (ML), this study investigated whether measured root length densities (RLD) at different soil depths were related to uptake of isotope tracer (15N) and drought stress indicator (13C) in wheat, to reveal root function. 

Methods
In the RadiMax semi-field root-screening facility 95/120 different winter wheat genotypes were phenotyped for root growth in 2018/2019, respectively. Root images were acquired across a depth range from 70 cm to 220 cm in May, June, and July of both years, using the minirhizotron technique. From these images, the RLD was extracted using a convolutional neural network. We developed machine learning algorithms to explore whether the RLD estimates at different soil depths were predictive of the uptake of deep soil nitrogen - using deep placement of 15N tracer. These algorithms were also used to understand if RLD estimates can predict drought resilience potential of genotypes using natural abundance of 13C isotope as an indicator of drought resilience. We also estimated the maximum root depth by fitting the density measurements to analytical models. 

In the statistical analysis, we computed the correlation between both ML predictions and analytical depth estimates to the isotope composition using five-fold cross-validation. We further analyzed the genotypic effects on root function using mediation analysis. 

Results: 
Both analytical and machine learning based models demonstrated strong correlations between RLD distribution and resource uptake. The ML models demonstrated that roots in deeper soil layers from 150-170 cm were most important for predicting the plant content of 15N and 13C isotopes. The correlations were higher in 2018 than in the 2019. 
Conclusions: 
The results demonstrated that in the semi-field non-invasive root phenotyping setup, both analytical and ML based analysis provided valuable insight into the importance of deep rooting for water and nitrogen uptake.
